My name is Keegan Gunderson, I have lived in Utah and Idaho. I just barely swithed to biostatistcs hopes to become a doctor of Internal Medicine or a statistician on a medical research team. I don't have many hobbies due to school consuming most of my time. I really enjoy learning and the benefits it bring.

The class is built this way to make us struggle, to make us want to become something that we were not before. The ability to struggle is usually something scary,  but after going through this class so far I have learned how to communicate and ask for help when I needed it. This class gives us the ability to think for ourselves.

1. My goals for the rest of the semester are to understand to get a good base understanding of strings, and do all of the reading even when it seems daunting. I really want an A and I know itâ€™s not unattainable.   
 
2. I will do spend more time doing the case study by that I mean I will start downloading the material for it on Monday or Tuesday and work on it throughout the week instead of waiting till Friday and Saturday to bust it out. I am going to keep pushing before the task due date as well.# Math
